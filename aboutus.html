                A small business started in March 1988. It was named as the ‘ABC Book Shop’ and was located at No.49, Dalada Street, Kandy. This place was only 200 Square Feet but was the first step towards a long journey.
                1995 was a better year for us as we expanded our service to a spacious place which was also located in Puttlam Road and was branded as ‘ABC Book Curio’ this was a landmark for the ABC Group as this place was Air conditioned, Self Service and specialized 90% for its capacity for the printed books.
